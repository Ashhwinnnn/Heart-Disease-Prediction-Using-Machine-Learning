# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Predict Today. Protect Tomorrow.**

This project predicts the risk of heart disease based on health metrics using a Random Forest Classifier, enhanced with custom features like Body Mass Index (BMI) and Pulse Pressure for better accuracy.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Heart disease remains a major global health concern. Early detection is key to prevention.  
Using machine learning, this project offers a fast, data-driven approach to predict heart disease risk based on common health indicators.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)

---

## ðŸ“š Features Engineered
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)** calculation
- **Pulse Pressure** calculation (Systolic - Diastolic)
- **Outlier Removal** for clean, reliable data

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. **Upload dataset** (`cardio_train.csv`).
2. **Preprocess data** (handle outliers, create BMI and Pulse Pressure features).
3. **Train model** (Random Forest Classifier).
4. **Take user input** (health data like age, BP, cholesterol, etc.).
5. **Predict risk** of heart disease instantly.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
- Random Forest model trained with custom feature engineering.
- Improved prediction accuracy with BMI and Pulse Pressure enhancements.
- Confusion matrix and feature importance visualized.
